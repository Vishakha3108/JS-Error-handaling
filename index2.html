    <!-- Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containig a person's first name, last name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string and store it in a variable called fullNmae. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a variable called ageInDays.

    The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format : "The person's full name is [full name] and their age in days [age in days]."
    
    Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time. -->

    <script>
        function ageInDays(person) {

            const fullName = person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;

            const ageInDays = person.age * 365;

            function logMessage() {
                console.log(`The person's full name is ${fullName} and their age in days is ${ageInDays}.`);
            }

            return logMessage;
        }

        const person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 30
        };

        const logFunction = ageInDays(person);
        logFunction();
